Updated examples from Jeff La Marche's excellent [OpenGL ES blog series](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/opengl-es-from-ground-up-table-of.html).
Most of the links in Jeff's blog are out of date. But I found a repo with his [old blog code](https://github.com/jlamarche/Old-Blog-Code).
Unfortunately those didn't work out of the box. This repo fixes those examples for the current XCode version, which is 7.2.
